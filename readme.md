# Pattern Library Template

## With IE8

This template gets you set up with everything you need to get started on your own pattern library.

## Set up
In order to run this pattern library genrator correctly you'll need to follow a couple of steps first.

1. `$ gem install jekyll` — If you don't already have jekyll on your machine.
2. `$ npm install` — To get all the dependencies for grunt.
3. `$ bower install` — To get all the dependencies for bower.

## Running the project
Run `grunt` or `grunt serve` on the command line and the project will build itself, set up a server, open the index page, and wait for you to make changes.

## Building the project
Once you're happy with everything, run `grunt build` and it will compile everything ready for production. All the built files will go into the `web` directory, just point your server here and you're good to go.

Optionally, you can set your pattern library up on GitHub pages. I'll pull together a more tailored walkthrough but for now you can get the basic jist [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually).
